Another stupid awesome list of hands-on stuff for my research. (I rarely do research and this repository will be forgotten probably.)

- https://github.com/rasbt/deeplearning-models
  - A collection of quite well-known deep learning models implementation.
  - A good starting point at the kickoff of the new research.
  - pytorch, tensorflow implementation
- https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models
  - An extensive collection of pytorch implementations for image models
  - It includes quite latest models and it is still being updated.
