Another my stupid awesome list of useful stuff for my research. (I rarely do research and this repository will be forgotten probably.)

### Deep learning
- https://github.com/rasbt/deeplearning-models
  - A collection of quite well-known deep learning models implementation.
  - A good starting point at the kickoff of the new research.
  - pytorch, tensorflow implementation
- https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models
  - An extensive collection of pytorch implementations for image models
  - It includes quite latest models and it is still being updated.

### Machine learning
- https://github.com/probml/pyprobml
  - Jupyter notebook examples for Probabilistic Machine Learning (https://probml.github.io/pml-book/)

### Tools
- https://github.com/thisiscam/math-with-slack
  - Rendered math (MathJax) with Slack's desktop client (i.e. it will render latex syntax after installation.)
  - For some cultivated people who talk with math equations in slack

### Youtube Channels
- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUxGBfUhv_FqfArqedqOCSA
  - Shannon channels
  - Talks about information theory, learning, communication theory
- https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWdIX5vwqHpDc4kaRK3M3yQ
  - TCS+
  - Talks about theoretical computer science
- https://www.youtube.com/c/SimonsInstitute/featured
  - Simons Institute
  - CS and Math (all the topics, I guess)
